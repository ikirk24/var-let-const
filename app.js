// 2. Whats the difference between var and let?
//      Answer: Var is scoped to the whole variable and can be reassigned and redeclared. Var is also hoisted to the top of the scope it is defined in. Let can only be reassigned but not redeclared. Let also only exists inside of the code-block it is assigned in. 
// 3. What's the difference between var and const?
//      Answer: Var can be reassigned and redeclared but const can't be reassigned or redeclared. Var is hoisted to the top of the scope while const creates a block-scope.
